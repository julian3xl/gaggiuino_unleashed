### DISCLAMER

This repository is a modification of the original [Gaggiuino](https://gaggiuino.github.io/#/) with the goal of having a more developer/diy-lover focused project.

Project main goals:

* Return this project to the origin, why don't make good coffee with an arduino nano?
* Eliminates commercial stuff references. This is a project from the community, to the community.
* Huge code refactor to support variety of hardware and eliminates hardware dependencies.
* Reduce modules coupling so you can compile it choosing your own hardware and also contribute with more hardware.
***

Again, this is a project from the community, to the community. I don't sell anything and I won't sell anything. This is a fully DIY project.
